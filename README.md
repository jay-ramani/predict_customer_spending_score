## Approach of Analysis
The approach of analysis:
1. Gain a deep understanding of the business problem that needs to be solved, and the outcome that needs to be delivered (detailed out in writing)
2. Understand the data; what impact (if any) do each of the existing features have on the others? Are additional features needed? 
3. Determine if the data has natural clustering or groupings of customers and if there are any patterns
4. Create a baseline regression model, and test it against a validation data set - fine tune the predictions to maximize
5. Revisit the problem statement to confirm if it has been addressed
